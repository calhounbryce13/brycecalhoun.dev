                <p>An index file serves as a type of homepage
                    for a web server. Any requests for resources
                    will be mapped to this file.
                </p>
                <p>After uploading the <s>assignment1</s> folder to the 
                    engineering server, There is now an additional 
                    status line for the favorites icon <strong>(favicon)</strong> that
                    was loaded successfully with code 200.
                </p>
                <p> The Favicon.ico file has a 200 <strong>status code</strong> because
                    the favicon.ico file is facilitated by the engineering server.
                    There were no CSS or JavaScript files uploaded with the index.html file,
                    therefore the 404 page not found status code was used.

                    in this URL, HTTPS is a secure <strong>hypertext transfer protocol</strong>  scheme. 
                    The server name/host name is web.engr.oregonstate.edu, and the path to the specific

                <h3>Frontend Design</h3>

                <p>Frontend design is a process that's implemented in order
                    to facilitate a positive experience for a user of a web
                    service or application. Frontend design emphasizes crafting
                    an efficient user experience. This process includes both the 
                    <strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</strong> as well as the manner in which the user 
                    interacts with the software. A consistent color and font scheme is crucial
                    to frontend design. Additionally, navigational systems that make sense in the 
                    context of the application are just as imperative.

                <p>The <strong>header</strong> tag marks the banner or headline for the application
                    and typically stays the same between each webpage. The <strong>nav</strong> tag 
                    acts as a navigation block and can be used various times throughout
                    a webpage. Navigation blocks store links to other webpages or sites.
                    The <strong>main</strong> tag is simply a layout tag that signifies the primary block 
                    of content for that page. The <strong>section</strong> tag is used to group together 
                    content thematically. Typically, a headline tag will follow to describe that
                    section. The <strong>article</strong> tag is mostly used within a section tag
                    and often comes with a second level headline tag. The <strong>aside</strong> tag
                    will include content that is related to an article. This information is often seen 
                    floating off of the side of text. The <strong>figure/figcaption</strong> tags are similar to the aside tag,
                    except they are used mostly for media instead of text. The <strong>blockquote</strong> 
                    tag is reserved for quotes that are longer than paragraph length. The <strong>footer</strong> tag is used below 
                    the main tag and will usually hold legal content or contact information. Finally, the <strong>div</strong> 
                    tag is used as a placeholder for dynamic content or simply to visually divide sections.

                <h3>Optimizing Images</h3>
                <p>
                    There are 6 major specifications for web images to ensure that quality and 
                    appropriate photos are uploaded to web pages. The first is a descriptive filename,
                    this allows improved <strong>search engine optimization(SEO).</strong> Another
                    would be to ensure a small file size so that the load time for each image is as fast 
                    as possible. Next, the exact dimensions of the image are needed so that the image doesn't 
                    take up any extra space or look too small. The correct file format is also required in order 
                    to optimize the graphics of the image. Reduced resolution is also important to make sure that 
                    different monitors load the image based on the screen resolution. Finally, color mode allows 
                    for the true colors of the image to show.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are various file formats that are appropriate for media, depending on the type 
                    of image. For photography and images .jpg or WebP work the best whereas for line art 
                    <strong>.gif</strong> and <strong>.png</strong> work better.

                <h3>Favicons</h3>
                <p>
                    Favicon stands for <strong>favorite's icon</strong>, it is an effective and efficient way 
                    to make a webpage more noticeable and stand out against others. The favicon 
                    is a small logo that appears next to the site name in the browser tab.
                    Favicons can be saved in various file formats. The browser will read the 
                    file and anchor the favicon to the favorites list or bookmarks. Different 
                    devices will display favicons differently. On a phone or mobile device, the 
                    favicon may be displayed as an app logo.

            <article id="JavaScript">
                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <p>
                    There are 6 main data types in JavaScript. Those data types are 
                    <strong>string, number, boolean, symbol, object,</strong> or 
                    the <strong>null/undefined</strong> keyword. JavaScript variables allow 
                    for something called <strong>dynamic typing</strong>, where the type of a variable can be
                    overwritten by assigning it to a value of a different data type.
                    <strong>Objects</strong> are non-primitive data types in JavaScript that 
                    allow for the storage of key-value pairs, where the keys are referred to as 
                    <strong>properties</strong>. Objects are used in JavaScript by either <strong>reading </strong>
                    values from the object's properties, <strong>updating</strong> values, or <strong>deleting</strong>
                    values. An array in JavaScript is made by making an object without property names, 
                    JavaScript will automatically use the <strong>strings</strong> 0, 1, 2,... as the 
                    property names. Arrays are used by accessing values within them with square brackets "[]".
                    <strong>JSON</strong> is a format for working with data in various applications and objects in various languages.
                    JSON format can be utilized to map an object in a programming language to a string in JSON. <strong>Conditionals and loops</strong> 
                    are used to manipulate the flow of the program in JavaScript. Some examples include using a <strong>for in</strong> loop to 
                    iterate through a JavaScript object, or checking to make sure a certain value within an <strong>array</strong> matches user input.
                    <strong>Object-oriented programming </strong> describes utilizing the <strong>class</strong> and <strong>new</strong> 
                    keywords to define a class prototype and then make an instance of an object respectively. Classes can have added functionality through
                    the use of <strong>methods</strong> that can be added to a class definition. In JavaScript functions are treated as 
                    <strong> first class</strong> values, which means they can be assigned to variables, can be defined to 
                    receive other functions as arguments, and can be defined to return functions as well.<strong> Functional programming</strong> 
                    includes the use of <strong>higher order functions</strong>, which are functions that recieve functions are arguments.

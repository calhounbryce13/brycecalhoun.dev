                    My name is Bryce Calhoun, I was born in sunny San Diego, CA, and moved 
                    to <strong>Los Angeles</strong> when I was nine, where I grew up and 
                    graduated from Ulysses S. Grant High School. Afterward, 
                    I made the exciting move to Oregon to kickstart my 
                    academic journey! I'm currently an undergraduate at <strong>Oregon 
                    State University</strong>, majoring in Computer Science with a focus 
                    on Artificial Intelligence. I'm incredibly passionate about 
                    areas like <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Celestial 
                    Mechanics</strong> and <strong>Network Architecture</strong>, 
                    and I'm extremely eager to dive deeper into these fields. I can't wait 
                    to continue my studies and work toward earning my bachelor's 
                    degree in Computer Science.

                <p id="researchTxt" class="mainTxt left">
                    Computer vision is a new and exciting field within the context of
                    artificial intelligence that comes with lots of opportunities for 
                    valuable applications. It's only natural to wonder if computer vision
                    could help us understand our own health better. This was the exact purpose
                    for this longitudinal study. The <strong>data preprocessing</strong> included publicly available 
                    Twitter data that took well over a year's time to finilize. Some key takeaways 
                    from this project are that while unsurprisingly, the human eye remains the leading authority
                    in the detection of visual health outcomes and health-contributing environmental features,
                    there is a massive potential in the refinement of computer vision models for the 
                    identification of complex emotional health outcomes. This is especially the case in the context 
                    of children in schools. For a more detailed summary <a href="media/Slide1.PNG" class="lowkeyLink" target="_blank">here</a>

                            <strong>React</strong> is a popular JS library for

                            React follows a declarative approach, where developers 
                            describe how the UI should look based on the state, 
                            and React takes care of updating the view when the 
                            state changes. React's component-based architecture 
                            also promotes maintainability and scalability for 
                            complex applications.

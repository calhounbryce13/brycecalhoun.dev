                <p id="Txt">
                    
                I was born in San Diego, California, and subsequently 
                relocated to Los Angeles at the age of 9. I remained 
                in Los Angeles until my graduation from 
                Ulysses S. Grant High School. Following this, I transitioned 
                to Oregon to embark on my academic journey. Currently enrolled as 
                an undergraduate student at <strong>Oregon State University</strong>, my major course 
                of study is computer science, specializing in artificial intelligence. 
                My academic interests center around areas such as artificial intelligence, 
                machine learning, and algorithm design as well as a few other areas. 
                With a targeted culmination in 
                June 2025, I anticipate obtaining a bachelor's degree in computer science.

                        Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime 
                        environment that facilitates the development and execution 
                        of JavaScript code beyond the confines of a web browser. 
                        This versatile environment is underpinned by the V8 JavaScript 
                        engine, enabling server-side programming and offering a unified 
                        language experience for developers.
                        Integral to Node.js is its package management system, known as 
                        Node Package Manager <strong>(NPM)</strong>. NPM serves as a comprehensive toolset 
                        that empowers users to seamlessly install, manage, and share 
                        libraries and packages, thereby enhancing the efficiency and 
                        collaborative aspects of software development within the Node.js ecosystem.

                        beyond the confines of a web browser. Consequently, Express has emerged as a 
                        favored framework among web developers, enabling the creation of sophisticated

                        React is an open-source collection of JavaScript tools designed to 
                        facilitate the creation of user interfaces, particularly for single-page 
                        applications <strong>(SPAs)</strong>. In React-based applications, the user interface is 
                        constructed as a cohesive assembly of individual components. This modular 
                        approach simplifies the management of an application's interface by breaking 
                        it down into self-contained and reusable components. The inherent 
                        structure of React applications alleviates the challenges associated with 
                        scaling and maintenance, contributing to a more efficient development process.

                        Computer vision is a new and exciting field within the context of
                        artificial intelligence that comes with lots of opportunities for 
                        valuable applications. It's only natural to wonder if computer vision
                        could help us understand our own health better. This was the exact purpose
                        for this longitudinal study. The <strong>data preprocessing</strong> included publicly available 
                        Twitter data that took well over a year's time to finilize. Some key takeaways 
                        from this project are that while unsurprisingly, the human eye remains the leading authority
                        in the detection of visual health outcomes and health-contributing environmental features,
                        there is a massive potential in the refinement of computer vision models for the 
                        identification of complex emotional health outcomes. This is especially the case in the context 
                        of children in schools. For a more detailed summary <a href="Slide1.PNG" class="lowkeyLink">here</a>

                            deep-learning tools, this project was all about my introduction 
                            to <strong>tensors</strong> and how they are connected to the deep learning process. 
                            Over the span of this project I was able to ascertain some of 
                            the integral principles and what it means to “learn” information. 
                            Additionally, another outcome of this project is that I was able to 
                            understand the extremely essential role the idea of “randomness” plays 
                            in shaping how intelligent agents can learn. In conclusion, this project 
                            served as a significant introduction to a prevalent deep-learning tool 
                            within the industry, emphasizing my initial exploration of tensors and 
                            their crucial role in the deep learning process.

                            of artificial intelligence seemed to be the best way to comprehend 
                            the nature of what it means to implement intelligence in a practical 
                            context. The goal of this project was to get my feet wet in the area 
                            of AI and start my journey with firm roots. Over the course of this 
                            project I learned a great deal about intelligence and the basic idea 
                            that the more effort you put into the thought process of a single decision, 
                            the more intelligent that decision becomes, quite literally in a quantifiable 
                            way. In conclusion  I have not only gained valuable insights into the intricacies 
                            of artificial intelligence but also established my own <strong>knowledge base</strong> with 
                            respect to artificial intelligence.
